# McXross and Aptos Foundation Collaborate on [Kaptos](https://github.com/mcxross/kaptos) SDK

## Overview

McXross, supported by a grant from the Aptos Foundation, has developed **[Kaptos](https://github.com/mcxross/kaptos)**, a Kotlin Multiplatform SDK that enables developers to interact seamlessly with the Aptos blockchain using Kotlin. This collaboration advances the Aptos developer ecosystem and reflects the Foundation's commitment to expanding blockchain accessibility across platforms.

## Project Purpose

**[Kaptos](https://github.com/mcxross/kaptos)** simplifies interaction with the Aptos blockchain for Android and JVM developers by providing:
